The kind of action The Open University of Sri Lanka will take to manage the excitement of student
isolation in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is the introduction of a Virtual Study Groups and
Social Learning Platform. This platform is designed to bring students together to collaborate and
create a vibrant community mostly and probably even without physical presence.
The platform is established to be a center of interaction through virtual study groups, shared
whiteboards, discussion forums, peer mentoring. This will undergo intensive analysis of
requirements, design of user interface, and a strong foundation through robust data management-
It also aims to fully utilize the modern communication tools and gamification in learning experience
to catapult the ODL into a revolutionized student engagement and support, yet one firmly laying the
foundations for improvement in the future.
